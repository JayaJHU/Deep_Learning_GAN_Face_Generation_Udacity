# Udacity_DL_Face_Generation_GAN_Project

Face Generation

In this project, I used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, I will be able to visualize the results of my trained Generator to see how it performs; my generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
